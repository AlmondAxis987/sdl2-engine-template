# sdl2-engine-template
A simple SDL2 Engine Boilerplate for C++ (Windowsx64)

-- SDL Game Boilerplate -- 2023 -- By AlmondAxis987 -- 
This is a simple boilerplate for 2D SDL 2.0 games. 
Declare sprites and other variables in "game.hpp", then define them in the "load()" function in 1st Function Pair (functions1.cpp)
They can be rendered in the "draw()" function, also in the 1st Function Pair, and updated in "update()" function present in 2nd Function Pair (functions2.cpp)

Any and all events will be handled in the "events(SDL_Evenr event)" function in 2nd Function Pair.
Comments explaining functions and files are placed wherever necessary.
